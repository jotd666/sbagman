- test search key phase: OK but ACT 0!!
- bomb blasts wall OK, but switch screens and wall is back again (can be crossed, though)
- if lose with the gun gun not drawn at screen 3
- armurerie in english at screen 3: doesn't work despite tiles defined!
- bomb exploding save/restore background doesn't work for bottom left
  tile.
- big bagman fingers animation is wrong
- write a script to detect move.w to/from ram: in progress

- hard bags locations to code

- maybe fix original bug: threaten guard with pickaxe so it doesn't move and disappears???
- gun cheat doesn't work properly. act 2 gun set must happen too soon
  vs start of the game

- maybe omit tiles 0x249-24B and handle this with update_bg_tile
- sometimes mechanical stairs appear in the bagman title!! (maybe ok now)
- optimize l_c16d with AND?

- original bug (can't reproduce)? high fall into a wagon: makes "et hopla" wagon drop sound
  then dies instead of playing dying sound
