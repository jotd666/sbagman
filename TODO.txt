- very easy mode
- validate command line arguments
- highscore entry: cannot enter more than 3 letters
- music tune 1 start & len problem tune 3 problem
- when music is completed, step sound fx go crazy
- too much memory used when music is on

- invincible flag doesn't work for gun: to test
- hard bags locations cheat
- gun cheat doesn't work properly. act 2 gun set must happen too soon
  vs start of the game

minor/not reproduced:

- maybe fix original bug: threaten guard with pickaxe so it doesn't move and disappears???
- maybe omit tiles 0x249-24B and handle this with update_bg_tile
- optimize l_c16d with AND?
- original bug (can't reproduce)? high fall into a wagon: makes "et hopla" wagon drop sound
  then dies instead of playing dying sound
- sometimes mechanical stairs appear in the bagman title!! (maybe ok now, well, not sure)
