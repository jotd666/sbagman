- guard monitoring doesn't work?? when waiting for elevator 5, guard
  disappears (unknown_6156??)
- unknown_pointer_62DB MSB gets corrupted: e22c loads 62DA,
  e291 writes a3+1!!

- test elevator level 4 doesn't carry player at ground level! lifts player
  then drops him!!!!
- pick pickaxe/barrow/bomb problem!
* pickaxe: stays stuck
* bomb: error, dropped immediately
* bomb: dbfd called with screen_base_screen_address_6326 = 0 !
* barrow: disappears immediately

- sync in mainloop makes 50Hz not 60
- dies: too long wait
- gun status not flashing in the bottom

- armurerie in english at screen 3: doesn't work despite tiles defined!
- write a script to detect move.w to/from ram
- highscore when not reached a highscore: check time
- gun tile: wrong color: same cyan as V/A title should be replaced
  by bomb blue
- big bagman fingers animation is wrong
- reduce memory footprint (> 1MB!)
- new code unknown_609F D1AE
- debug: l_f4f2
- check TODO (almost no sfx are active...)

z80 conv: 
- review move.w into address register inc hl/dec hl => subq.w
- cmp + roxr/roxl
