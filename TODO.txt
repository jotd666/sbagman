- guard monitoring doesn't work?? when waiting for elevator 5, guard
  disappears (unknown_6156??: move.b	d6,d0                           	| [$da3e: ld   a,l])
  debug MAME da3e

- dropping object save/restore background doesn't work every time properly
  try blasting a ladder & debug (1FF / F => FF 1F)
  
- test elevator level 4 doesn't carry player at ground level! lifts player
  slightly then drops him!!!! works at other stops!!!
  also works with other configuration

  real machine/68k port: player Y = e0, elevator = e1
  Y alignment occurs when player is being lifted by elevator
  in l_c15f. Happens too often at some point on 68k version: player not
  taken by elevator!
  
- optimize l_c16d with AND?

- draw_explosion_frame_dd2b seems incorrect in the end / background not restored
  explosion frames remain like if tiles weren't recognized anymore

- gun cheat doesn't work properly. act 2 gun set must happen too soon
  vs start of the game
- if lose with the gun sometimes gun not drawn at screen 3
- guard sometimes stuck climbing down stairs (until sees player), 
  random bug stuck at the bottom of ladder for player too
- armurerie in english at screen 3: doesn't work despite tiles defined!
- write a script to detect move.w to/from ram
- highscore when not reached a highscore: check time
- big bagman fingers animation is wrong
- sometimes mechanical stairs appear in the bagman title!!
- new code unknown_address_609F D1AE
- debug: l_f4f2
