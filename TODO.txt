* real machine: player Y = e0, elevator = e1

- guard sometimes stuck climbing down stairs (until sees player)
- sync in mainloop makes 50Hz not 60: use a simple flag instead of osd_wait
- armurerie in english at screen 3: doesn't work despite tiles defined!
- write a script to detect move.w to/from ram
- highscore when not reached a highscore: check time
- gun tile: wrong color: same cyan as V/A title should be replaced
  by bomb blue
- big bagman fingers animation is wrong
- new code unknown_address_609F D1AE
- debug: l_f4f2
- check TODO (almost no sfx are active...)
