minor/not reproduced:

- maybe fix original bug: threaten guard with pickaxe so it doesn't move and disappears???
- maybe omit tiles 0x249-24B and handle this with update_bg_tile
- optimize l_c16d with AND?
- original bug (can't reproduce)? high fall into a wagon: makes "et hopla" wagon drop sound
  then dies instead of playing dying sound
