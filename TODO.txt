- validate command line arguments
- when dying music should restart as first music!

- hard bags locations cheat
- gun cheat doesn't work properly. act 2 gun set must happen too soon
  vs start of the game

minor/not reproduced:

- maybe fix original bug: threaten guard with pickaxe so it doesn't move and disappears???
- maybe omit tiles 0x249-24B and handle this with update_bg_tile
- optimize l_c16d with AND?
- original bug (can't reproduce)? high fall into a wagon: makes "et hopla" wagon drop sound
  then dies instead of playing dying sound
