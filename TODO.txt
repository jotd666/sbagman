- guard doesn't seem killed by bomb
- guard monitoring doesn't work?? when waiting for elevator 5, guard
  disappears (unknown_6156??: move.b	d6,d0                           	| [$da3e: ld   a,l])
  debug MAME da3e
  
- record bomb sound, insert at dccd
- gun cheat doesn't work properly. act 2 gun set must happen too soon
  vs start of the game
- optimize elevator X test
- test elevator level 4 doesn't carry player at ground level! lifts player
  slightly then drops him!!!! works at other levels!!!

- draw_explosion_frame_dd2b seems incorrect

* real machine/68k port: player Y = e0, elevator = e1
  Y alignment occurs when player is in being lifted by elevator
  in l_c15f. Investigate value unknown_600C:  computed by 
  l_c16d which requires debugging in the elevator where it's not zero
  Y=0x70 => D1=0
  Y=0x55 => D1=5
  Y=0x52 => D1=2
  optimize l_c16d with AND?

- guard sometimes stuck climbing down stairs (until sees player)
- armurerie in english at screen 3: doesn't work despite tiles defined!
- write a script to detect move.w to/from ram
- highscore when not reached a highscore: check time
- gun tile: wrong color: same cyan as V/A title should be replaced
  by bomb blue
- big bagman fingers animation is wrong
- new code unknown_address_609F D1AE
- debug: l_f4f2
- check TODO (almost no sfx are active...)
