- guard monitoring doesn't work?? when waiting for elevator 5, guard
  disappears (unknown_6156??: move.b	d6,d0  	| [$da3e: ld   a,l]): test again!!
  debug MAME da3e

- test search key phase!

- bomb blasts wall OK, but switch screens and wall is back again (can be crossed, though)

- if lose with the gun gun not drawn at screen 3
- armurerie in english at screen 3: doesn't work despite tiles defined!

- dropping object save/restore background doesn't work for bottom left
  tile.
  
- optimize l_c16d with AND?


- typing sound missing
- guard killed sound missing

- maybe fix original bug: threaten guard with pickaxe so it doesn't move and disappears???
- gun cheat doesn't work properly. act 2 gun set must happen too soon
  vs start of the game

- maybe omit tiles 0x249-24B and handle this with update_bg_tile
- highscore screen missing frames: save screen
- guard sometimes stuck climbing down stairs (until sees player), 
  random bug stuck at the bottom of ladder for player too
- write a script to detect move.w to/from ram
- highscore when not reached a highscore: check time
- big bagman fingers animation is wrong
- sometimes mechanical stairs appear in the bagman title!!
- new code unknown_address_609F D1AE
- debug: l_f4f2

- original bug (can't reproduce)? high fall into a wagon: makes "et hopla" wagon drop sound
  then dies instead of playing dying sound
