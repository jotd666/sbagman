- test bagman first opus and publish!!
- very easy mode
- validate command line arguments
- integrate music

minor/not reproduced:

- hard bags locations cheat to code
- gun cheat doesn't work properly. act 2 gun set must happen too soon
  vs start of the game
- invincible flag doesn't work for gun
- maybe fix original bug: threaten guard with pickaxe so it doesn't move and disappears???
- maybe omit tiles 0x249-24B and handle this with update_bg_tile
- optimize l_c16d with AND?
- original bug (can't reproduce)? high fall into a wagon: makes "et hopla" wagon drop sound
  then dies instead of playing dying sound
- sometimes mechanical stairs appear in the bagman title!! (maybe ok now, well, not sure)
