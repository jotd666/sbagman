SKILL: difficulty dip switch. Default: very easy mode
STARTLIVES: 2,3,4,5 lives dip switch

Very easy mode:

The game is brutally hard, even in easy mode. There are 2 reasons for that:
- guards speed is crazy towards the end, faster than bagman
- timer at 4000 is just not enough for 5 screens and the level 5 elevator

Act 1 can still be completed like that, but act 2 is near impossible (plus the
guards now shoot on sight). So very easy mode tries to make game easier

- timer is now 6000
- score is 1/2th of the score in the other (arcade) modes
- guards speed won't be as crazy, because of lower score but also
  because of a speed limitation I have added (matches max Bagman speed)


Hiscores save:

* If any cheat key is pressed (when cheatkeys are on), highscores won't be saved
* Same thing if bonus cheat is selected
* whdload: quit whdload with quitkey to allow highscore save
* floppy: quit game with "ESC" and unprotect the floppy to allow highscore save
